Build Prerequisites
===================

Before you can build Ceph source code or Ceph documentation, you need to install several libraries and tools.

.. tip:: Check this section to see if there are specific prerequisites for your Linux/Unix distribution.

Prerequisites for Building Ceph Source Code
===========================================
Ceph provides ``autoconf`` and ``automake`` scripts to get you started quickly. Ceph build scripts
depend on the following:

- ``autotools-dev``
- ``autoconf``
- ``automake``
- ``cdbs``
- ``gcc``
- ``g++``
- ``git``
- ``libboost-dev``
- ``libedit-dev``
- ``libssl-dev``
- ``libtool``
- ``libfcgi``
- ``libfcgi-dev``
- ``libfuse-dev``
- ``linux-kernel-headers``
- ``libcrypto++-dev``
- ``libcrypto++``
- ``libexpat1-dev``
- ``libgtkmm-2.4-dev``
- ``pkg-config``

On Ubuntu, execute ``sudo apt-get install`` for each dependency that isn't installed on your host. ::

	$ sudo apt-get install autotools-dev autoconf automake cdbs
  	  gcc g++ git libboost-dev libedit-dev libssl-dev libtool
  	  libfcgi libfcgi-dev libfuse-dev linux-kernel-headers
  	  libcrypto++-dev libcrypto++ libexpat1-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev

On Debian/Squeeze, execute ``aptitude install`` for each dependency that isn't installed on your host. ::

	$ aptitude install autotools-dev autoconf automake cdbs
  	  gcc g++ git libboost-dev libedit-dev libssl-dev libtool
  	  libfcgi libfcgi-dev libfuse-dev linux-kernel-headers
  	  libcrypto++-dev libcrypto++ libexpat1-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev


Ubuntu Requirements
-------------------

- ``uuid-dev``
- ``libkeytutils-dev``
- ``libgoogle-perftools-dev``
- ``libatomic-ops-dev``
- ``libaio-dev``
- ``libgdata-common``
- ``libgdata13``

Execute ``sudo apt-get install`` for each dependency that isn't installed on your host. ::

	$ sudo apt-get install uuid-dev libkeytutils-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev
	  libatomic-ops-dev libaio-dev libgdata-common libgdata13

Debian
------
Alternatively, you may also install::

	$ aptitude install fakeroot dpkg-dev
	$ aptitude install debhelper cdbs libexpat1-dev libatomic-ops-dev

openSUSE 11.2 (and later)
-------------------------

- ``boost-devel``
- ``gcc-c++``
- ``libedit-devel``
- ``libopenssl-devel``
- ``fuse-devel`` (optional)

Execute ``zypper install`` for each dependency that isn't installed on your host. ::

	$zypper install boost-devel gcc-c++ libedit-devel libopenssl-devel fuse-devel	

Prerequisites for Building Ceph Documentation
=============================================
Ceph utilizes Python's Sphinx documentation tool. For details on
the Sphinx documentation tool, refer to: `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_
Follow the directions at `Sphinx 1.1.3 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx>`_
to install Sphinx. To run Sphinx, with `admin/build-doc`, at least the following are required:

- ``python-dev``
- ``python-pip``
- ``python-virtualenv``
- ``libxml2-dev``
- ``libxslt-dev``
- ``doxygen``
- ``ditaa``
- ``graphviz``

Execute ``sudo apt-get install`` for each dependency that isn't installed on your host. ::

	$ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-virtualenv libxml2-dev libxslt-dev doxygen ditaa graphviz
