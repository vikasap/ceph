Installing Ceph Components
==========================
Storage clusters are the foundation of the Ceph system. Ceph storage hosts provide object storage. 
Clients access the Ceph storage cluster directly from an application (using ``librados``),
over an object storage protocol such as Amazon S3 or OpenStack Swift (using ``radosgw``), or with a block
device (using ``rbd``). To begin using Ceph, you must first set up a storage cluster.

The following sections provide guidance for configuring a storage cluster and installing Ceph components:
