==================================
 Recovering from ceph-osd failure
==================================

Single ceph-osd failure
=======================

When a ceph-osd process dies, the monitor will learn about the failure
from surviving ceph-osd daemons and report it via the ``ceph health``
command::

 $ ceph health
 HEALTH_WARN 1/3 in osds are down

Specifically, you will get a warning whenever there are ceph-osd
processes that are marked in and down.  You can identify which
ceph-osds are down with::

 $ ceph health detail
 HEALTH_WARN 1/3 in osds are down
 osd.0 is down since epoch 23, last address 192.168.106.220:6800/11080

Under normal circumstances, simply restarting the ceph-osd daemon will
allow it to rejoin the cluster and recover.  If there is a disk
failure or other fault preventing ceph-osd from functioning or
restarting, an error message should be present in its log file in
``/var/log/ceph``.  

If the daemon stopped because of a heartbeat failure, the underlying
kernel file system may unresponsive; check ``dmesg`` output for disk
or other kernel errors.

If the problem is a software error (failed assertion or other
unexpected error), it should be reported to the :ref:`mailing list
<mailing-list>`.


Full cluster
============

If the cluster fills up, the monitor will prevent new data from being
written.  The system puts ceph-osds in two categories: ``nearfull``
and ``full`, with configurable threshholds for each (80% and 90% by
default).  In both cases, full ceph-osds will be reported by ``ceph health``::

 $ ceph health
 HEALTH_WARN 1 nearfull osds
 osd.2 is near full at 85%

or::

 $ ceph health
 HEALTH_ERR 1 nearfull osds, 1 full osds
 osd.2 is near full at 85%
 osd.3 is full at 97%

The best way to deal with a full cluster is to add new ceph-osds,
allowing the cluster to redistribute data to the newly available
storage.


Homeless placement groups (PGs)
===============================

It is possible for all OSDs that had copies of a given PG to fail.  If
that's the case, that subset of the object store is unavailable, and
the monitor will receive no status updates for those PGs.  To detect
this situation, the monitor marks any PG whose primary OSD has failed
as `stale`.  For example::

 $ ceph health
 HEALTH_WARN 24 pgs stale; 3/300 in osds are down

You can identify which PGs are stale, and what the last OSDs to store
them were, with::

 $ ceph health detail
 HEALTH_WARN 24 pgs stale; 3/300 in osds are down
 ...
 pg 2.5 is stuck stale+active+remapped, last acting [2,0]
 ...
 osd.10 is down since epoch 23, last address 192.168.106.220:6800/11080
 osd.11 is down since epoch 13, last address 192.168.106.220:6803/11539
 osd.12 is down since epoch 24, last address 192.168.106.220:6806/11861

If we want to get PG 2.5 back online, for example, this tells us that
it was last managed by ceph-osds 0 and 2.  Restarting those ceph-osd
daemons will allow the cluster to recover that PG (and, presumably,
many others).


Stuck PGs
=========

It is normal for PGs to enter states like "degraded" or "peering"
following a failure.  Normally these states indicate the normal
progression through the failure recovery process.  However, if a PG
stays in one of these states for a long time this may be an indication
of a larger problem.  For this reason, the monitor will warn when PGs
get "stuck" in a non-optimal state.  Specifically, we check for:

* ``inactive`` - the PG has not been ``active`` for too long (i.e., hasn't
  been able to service read/write requests)
* ``unclean`` - the PG has not been ``clean`` for too long (i.e.,
  hasn't been able to completely recover from a previous failure
* ``stale`` - the PG status has not been updated by a ``ceph-osd``,
  indicating that all nodes storing this PG may be down

You can explicitly list stuck PGs with one of::

 $ ceph pg dump_stuck stale
 $ ceph pg dump_stuck inactive
 $ ceph pg dump_stuck unclean

For stuck stale PGs, it is normally a matter of getting the right ceph-osd
daemons running again.  For stuck inactive PGs, it is usually a peering problem
(see :ref:`failures-osd-peering`).  For stuck unclean PGs, there is usually something
preventing recovery from completing, like unfound objects (see :ref:`failures-osd-unfound`);

.. _failures-osd-peering:

PG down (peering failure)
=========================

In certain cases, the ceph-osd "peering" process can run into
problems, preventing a PG from becoming active and usable.  For
example, ``ceph health`` might report::

 $ ceph health detail
 HEALTH_ERR 7 pgs degraded; 12 pgs down; 12 pgs peering; 1 pgs recovering; 6 pgs stuck unclean; 114/3300 degraded (3.455%); 1/3 in osds are down
 ...
 pg 0.5 is down+peering
 pg 1.4 is down+peering
 ...
 osd.1 is down since epoch 69, last address 192.168.106.220:6801/8651

We can query the cluster to determine exactly why the PG is marked ``down`` with::

 $ ceph pg 0.5 query
 { "state": "down+peering",
   ...
   "recovery_state": [
        { "name": "Started\/Primary\/Peering\/GetInfo",
          "enter_time": "2012-03-06 14:40:16.169679",
          "requested_info_from": []},
        { "name": "Started\/Primary\/Peering",
          "enter_time": "2012-03-06 14:40:16.169659",
          "probing_osds": [
                0,
                1],
          "blocked": "peering is blocked due to down osds",
          "down_osds_we_would_probe": [
                1],
          "peering_blocked_by": [
                { "osd": 1,
                  "current_lost_at": 0,
                  "comment": "starting or marking this osd lost may let us proceed"}]},
        { "name": "Started",
          "enter_time": "2012-03-06 14:40:16.169513"}]}

The ``recovery_state`` section tells us that peering is blocked due to
down ceph-osd daemons, specifically osd.1.  In this case, we can start that ceph-osd
and things will recover.

Alternatively, if there is a catastrophic failure of osd.1 (e.g., disk
failure), we can tell the cluster that it is "lost" and to cope as
best it can.  Note that this is dangerous in that the cluster cannot
guarantee that the other copies of the data are consistent and up to
date.  To instruct Ceph to continue anyway::

 $ ceph osd lost 1

and recovery will proceed.


.. _failures-osd-unfound:

Unfound objects
===============

Under certain combinations of failures Ceph may complain about
"unfound" objects::

 $ ceph health detail
 HEALTH_WARN 1 pgs degraded; 78/3778 unfound (2.065%)
 pg 2.4 is active+degraded, 78 unfound

This means that the storage cluster knows that some objects (or newer
copies of existing objects) exist, but it hasn't found copies of them.
One example of how this might come about for a PG whose data is on ceph-osds
A and B:

* A goes down
* B handles some writes, alone
* A comes up
* A and B repeer, and the objects missing on A are queued for recovery.
* Before the new objects are copied, B goes down.

Now A knows that these object exist, but there is no live ceph-osd who
has a copy.  In this case, IO to those objects will block, and the
cluster will hope that the failed node comes back soon; this is
assumed to be preferable to returning an IO error to the user.

First, you can identify which objects are unfound with::

 $ ceph pg 2.4 list_missing [starting offset, in json]

 { "offset": { "oid": "",
      "key": "",
      "snapid": 0,
      "hash": 0,
      "max": 0},
  "num_missing": 0,
  "num_unfound": 0,
  "objects": [
     { "oid": "object 1",
       "key": "",
       "hash": 0,
       "max": 0 },
     ...
  ],
  "more": 0}

If there are too many objects to list in a single result, the ``more``
field will be true and you can query for more.  (Eventually the
command line tool will hide this from you, but not yet.)

Second, you can identify which OSDs have been probed or might contain
data::

 $ ceph pg 2.4 query
 ...
   "recovery_state": [
        { "name": "Started\/Primary\/Active",
          "enter_time": "2012-03-06 15:15:46.713212",
          "might_have_unfound": [
                { "osd": 1,
                  "status": "osd is down"}]},

In this case, for example, the cluster knows that ``osd.1`` might have
data, but it is down.  The full range of possible states include::

 * already probed
 * querying
 * osd is down
 * not queried (yet)

Sometimes it simply takes some time for the cluster to query possible
locations.  

It is possible that there are other locations where the object can
exist that are not listed.  For example, if a ceph-osd is stopped and
taken out of the cluster, the cluster fully recovers, and due to some
future set of failures ends up with an unfound object, it won't
consider the long-departed ceph-osd as a potential location to
consider.  (This scenario, however, is unlikely.)

If all possible locations have been queried and objects are still
lost, you may have to give up on the lost objects. This, again, is
possible given unusual combinations of failures that allow the cluster
to learn about writes that were performed before the writes themselves
are recovered.  To mark the "unfound" objects as "lost"::

 $ ceph pg 2.5 mark_unfound_lost revert

This the final argument specifies how the cluster should deal with
lost objects.  Currently the only supported option is "revert", which
will either roll back to a previous version of the object or (if it
was a new object) forget about it entirely.  Use this with caution, as
it may confuse applications that expected the object to exist.



Slow or unresponsive ceph-osd
=============================

If, for some reason, a ceph-osd is slow to respond to a request, it will
generate log messages complaining about requests that are taking too
long.  The warning threshold defaults to 30 seconds, and is configurable
via the ``osd op complaint time`` option.  When this happens, the cluster
log will receive messages like::

  osd.0 192.168.106.220:6800/18813 312 : [WRN] old request osd_op(client.5099.0:790 fatty_26485_object789 [write 0~4096] 2.5e54f643) v4 received at 2012-03-06 15:42:56.054801 currently waiting for sub ops

Possible causes include:

 * bad disk (check ``dmesg`` output)
 * kernel file system bug (check ``dmesg`` output)
 * overloaded cluster (check system load, iostat, etc.)
 * ceph-osd bug
